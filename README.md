For the second assignment for CTEC3905 I have decided to construct a game review website which uses the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. GITHUB will be used to show progess of my work by commiting as much as i can. 


first commit: first commit is to test the github account has been set up and working properly with the hello world inserted

second commit: added folders and the index and sytle page to github 

Third commit: The <header></header> and <footer></footer> have been constructed and will be moving onto the main body of each website page 

fourth commit: adds the image slideshow with the use of javascript to make it automatic and tried to adjust the mobile navigation. <section></section> tags will be used throughtout most of the website as it provides                        efficient spacing between every part of the website pages  

fifth commit: finished homepage by adding minor content to page by sectioning the images and the text 

sixth commit: Added in the video using the simple <video></video> tag for the overwatch page while creating characterb profile and images 

seventh commit: In this commit the overwatch page of the website has been completed, with the character profiles linking the the offical overwatch page itself. A tilt animation is also present. Work on the fifa page has                     started with the football icons utilzing a spin animation 

Eighth commit: Finished fifa icons which use a -360 degree animation with basic <a herf></a> links which have been optimized using CSS3 by changing border sizes, padding and colour scheme.
