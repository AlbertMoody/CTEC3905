<h1>P14155058</h1>

<h2>Nineth commit</h2>

<p> The text has been added for the destiny page which will later be edited with the css, an aside section will also be implemented on this page to show the full effect of html5</p>

<h2>Tenth commit</h2>

<p> The aside section has be added to the "destiny" page with an form element for users to submit requests regarding reviews, for the next commit i will be using iframe elements to embed youtube videos instead of using an actual video tag. Along side this a google maps API function will be added for third party features</p>

<h2> Eleventh commit</h2>

<P> In this commit the google maps API has been added to the homepage and has been made responsive to fit the screen at all times, however it does not any advanced features such as a set point on the map. It was created by using javascript but did not become functionally until an API key was obtained from the google developers website. Other development that was made in this commit was iframe videos from youtube being added to the "destiny" page. For the next commit the social media buttons that were added earlier will all link to their respected websites. </P>

<h2>Twelfth commit</h2>

<p>The footer links have been adjusted to suit the selected icon on each page. For the next commits the intial designs with be added to this README.md file </p>


 <h1>Wireframes/Intial Designs</h1>
 
 <P>The images and diagrams below are the design I constructed online for how i wanted my to look like. These include a number of wireframes that show what the designs look like on a computer, tablet and a phone</P>
 
 
 <h3> Homepage designs</h3>

 <img src="images/initial2.png" width="300px" height="500px">
 
 <p>The two images of the homepage are designs that were first considered for the look of the website. These were the most important as the homepage sets the tone for the rest of the website</p>
 
 <h3>Mobile Responsive design</h3>
 <img src="images/mobileview.png">
 <img src="images/mobileview2.png">
 
 <p>the first image is a simplified look at how the mobile view of the website would look like and the imahe beneth is a more detailed look at the page and all its contents, this is subject to chage as development goes on</p>
