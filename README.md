<p>For the second assignment for CTEC3905 I have decided to construct a game review website which uses the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. GITHUB will be used to show progess of my work by commiting as much as i can.</p> 

<h1>Commit history</h1>

<h2>second commit</h2> 

<p>added folders and the index and sytle page to github</p> 

<h2>Third commit </h2> 

<p>The header and footer have been constructed and will be moving onto the main body of each website page</p> 

<h2>fourth commit</h2>

<p>adds the image slideshow with the use of javascript to make it automatic and tried to adjust the mobile navigation. section tags will be used throughtout most of the website as it provide efficient spacing between every part of the website pages</p> 

<h2>fifth commit</h2> 

<p>finished homepage by adding minor content to page by sectioning the images and the text</p> 

<h2>sixth commit</h2> 

<p> Added in the video using the simple video tags for the overwatch page while creating characterb profile and images</p>

<h2>seventh commit</h2> 

<p>In this commit the overwatch page of the website has been completed, with the character profiles linking the the offical overwatch page itself. A tilt animation is also present. Work on the fifa page has started with the football icons utilzing a spin animation </p>

<h2>Eighth commit</h2> 

<p>Finished fifa icons which use a -360 degree animation with basic <a herf></a> links which have been optimized using CSS3 by changing border sizes, padding and colour scheme. </p>  

<h2>Nineth commit</h2>

<p> The text has been added for the destiny page which will later be edited with the css, an aside section will also be implemented on this page to show the full effect of html5</p>

<h2>Tenth commit</h2>

<p> The aside section has be added to the "destiny" page with an form element for users to submit requests regarding reviews, for the next commit i will be using iframe elements to embed youtube videos instead of using an actual video tag. Along side this a google maps API function will be added for third party features</p>
